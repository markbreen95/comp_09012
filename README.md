Project work for Machine Learning (COMP09012

# Environment setup

Open a command prompt/terminal window inside the project folder and create a virtual environment by running the following command:

```python -m venv env```

Activate the environment by running:

Windows:

```.\env\Scripts\activate```

Mac/Linux:

```source env/bin/activate```

This environment should contain any necessary packages for data ETL and fitting machine learning models. It also has Jupyter Notebook installed which is handy for data exploration.
